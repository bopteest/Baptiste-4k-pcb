Overview
This repository contains the PCB design files for a 4-key keyboard implemented using KiCad. The project was undertaken to gain proficiency in KiCad and serve as a stepping stone for more complex commissioned and personal projects. This simple yet functional 4-key keyboard is a great starting point for anyone looking to enhance their skills in PCB design and KiCad.

.

Features
-Compact 4-key layout for simplicity and ease of understanding.

-Utilizes MX switch design for a reliable and customizable key feel.

-Integrated with a Mega32 microcontroller, programmable using QMK firmware.

-Designed using KiCad, a powerful and open-source PCB design software.

-Minimalist design to focus on core concepts for beginners.

Exploring the Design

The schematic files (*.sch) and the PCB layout files (*.kicad_pcb) as well as all gerber files can be located in the 4k Folder.
Component footprints and symbols are stored in the footprints and symbols folders, respectively.

.

Customization

Feel free to modify and customize the design to suit your preferences or use it as a starting point for more complex projects. You can experiment with different key layouts, add more keys, or integrate additional features.
